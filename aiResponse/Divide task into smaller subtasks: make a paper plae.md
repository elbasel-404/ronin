```pseudocode
// Function to prepare the paper
function preparePaper() {
  // comment: Get a rectangular piece of paper
  // comment: Ensure paper is flat and crease-free for best results
}

// Function to perform the first fold (usually in half lengthwise)
function foldPaperInHalf() {
  // comment: Fold the paper in half lengthwise, bringing one short edge to the opposite short edge
  // comment: Crease firmly along the fold
  // comment: Unfold the paper - this creates a center crease as a guide
}

// Function to fold the top corners to the center crease to form the initial wing shape
function foldTopCornersToCenter() {
  // comment: Fold the top right corner to the center crease
  // comment: Crease firmly
  // comment: Fold the top left corner to the center crease, matching the first fold
  // comment: Crease firmly
  // comment: The top of the paper should now be pointed and triangular
}

// Function to fold the top edges down to form the wings
function foldWingsDown() {
  // comment: Fold the top edge of the right side down to meet the bottom edge, aligning with the center crease
  // comment: Crease firmly
  // comment: Fold the top edge of the left side down to meet the bottom edge, aligning with the center crease and matching the right side fold
  // comment: Crease firmly
  // comment: The paper plane shape should be forming now
}

// Function to make final adjustments and checks before flying
function finalizePaperPlane() {
  // comment: Check for symmetry - wings should be even
  // comment: Ensure all creases are firm and sharp
  // comment: Make any minor adjustments to wing shape or folds for better flight
  // comment: The paper plane is now ready to fly!
}

// Function to make a paper plane by calling all sub-tasks in order
function makePaperPlane() {
